The following ACM Subscriptions (Applications) have been created to deploy
GitOps repos:

{{ range .Values.clusters }}
* {{ .clusterName }} - {{ .chartName }} ({{ .repoUrl }})
{{ end }}

An ACM Governance Policy to install OpenShift GitOps on all ACM managed
clusters has also been created.

The full bootstrapping process may take up to 20 minutes.

--- WHAT'S NEXT ---

* In the next several minutes, OpenShift GitOps will be deployed across your
  clusters. You can monitor the progress on each cluster with:

    `oc get pods -n openshift-gitops`

* Once OpenShift GitOps is running (all pods are up and "Ready"), the
  applications specified in the GitOps repos above will be deployed through
  Argo CD. You can monitor the process by logging into Argo CD. Get the URL of
  Argo CD with:

    `oc get routes openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops`

* Additional ACM policies will be deployed once OpenShift GitOps is running
  (all pods are up and "Ready") on the Hub cluster. The ACM policies will
  enforce configurations across all clusters.
